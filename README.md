### Find

```
The attractive 3D parallax scrolling website SpaceJam made by me
is a beautiful animated space galaxy – in the centre of the page. 
The animated canine scales and rotates as you scroll down the parallax page. 
Its changes position as you hover over the titles of my certificate
collection and recent mostly finished projects. 
Perhaps your favourite touch is that at one point space revolves
in front of you. It's a very smooth presentation.
```
### Scroll

```
Parallax scrolling websites continue to be a popular trend. 
It was once recommended that sites include as much information
above the fold as possible in order to avoid the user having to 
scroll, but parallax scrolling introduced a way of allowing 
designers to break away from that by making the act of scrolling 
itself engaging for the user. 
```
### Parallax

```
The Parallax scrolling technique involves designing the background 
of a website layout to move at a slower rate than the foreground 
when the user scrolls, creating a 3D-like effect. Used sparingly,
parallax scrolling can add a subtle element of depth that makes the 
foreground seem to stand out. In other cases, it can be used as the 
main star of the show for a big visual impact. The technique can 
encourage users to stay on a page for longer – great for SEO – and 
to scroll right to the bottom of the content. The examples below show
how Parallax scrolling can be used to different degrees to create
distinctive and memorable websites.
